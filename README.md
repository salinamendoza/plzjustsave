Web app designed to help users save and manage important webpages directly within their browser so they can delete all their tabs

Here's what it includes:

* <b> Privacy-First Local Storage: </b> All saved data (URLs, titles, favicons, notes, and tags) is stored exclusively in your browser's local storage. There is no external tracking or server-side data collection.
* <b> Bookmarklet for Easy Saving: </b> It provides a JavaScript bookmarklet that you can drag to your browser's bookmarks bar. Clicking this bookmarklet on any webpage will automatically open the application in a new tab and save the current page's details.
* <b> Organized History Viewer: </b> You can view your saved pages, which are grouped by date.
* <b> Search and Filter Capabilities: </b> The application allows you to search through your saved pages by title, URL, notes, and tags. You can also filter your history by specific tags.
* Notes and Tags: For each saved page, you can add custom notes and assign multiple tags to help categorize and find information later.
* Data Management: You have options to export your saved history as a CSV file and import history from a JSON file. You can also delete individual saved pages or clear your entire history.
* Modern Web Technologies: The application is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS for a responsive and modern user interface, and uses Lucide React for icons.
